    <h1>In The Net offers lacrosse players a store where they can get equipment when they need it right away and can give advice to new players on what to get to help them start playing a new sport.
    </h1>   
    <h2>We want to help young kids to college aged players, from beginners to people who know the sport well.</h2>   
    <p>In the Net is a lacrosse store located in San Luis Obispo, California. With no other lacrosse store in San Luis Obispo or sport stores having any lacrosse equipment we want to grow the lacrosse community around us. We only have one store as of now in San Luis Obispo but are looking to grow their locations. We sell lacrosse supplies and offer lessons to help people get better at the sport.
